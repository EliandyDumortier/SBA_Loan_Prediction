# Comprehensive Data Cleaning and Analysis Plan

## 1. Initial Data Exploration and Understanding

### 1.1 Loading and Inspecting the Dataset
- Load the dataset into a pandas dataframe.
- Display the first few rows to understand the structure and content.
- Check the dimensions of the dataset (number of rows and columns).

### 1.2 Column Overview and Relevance Assessment
- Review column names and their meanings.
- Identify irrelevant or redundant columns (e.g., unique identifiers like `LoanNr_ChkDgt`).
- Verify data types (numerical, categorical, dates, etc.) and ensure consistency.

### 1.3 Statistical Summary and Data Distribution
- Generate descriptive statistics for numerical columns (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max).
- Summarize categorical columns (unique values, frequencies).
- Identify potential outliers in numerical columns.

### 1.4 Missing Data Analysis
- Identify columns with missing values (`NaN`) and calculate the percentage of missing data.
- Propose strategies to handle missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).

### 1.5 Domain-Specific Data Review
- Understand which columns are available **before** loan approval to avoid data leakage.
- Examples of columns to exclude:
  - `ChgOffDate` (charge-off date, known after loan approval).
  - `BalanceGross` (remaining balance, known after loan approval).
  - `MIS_Status` (final loan status, known after loan approval).

## 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

### 2.1 Removing Irrelevant or Redundant Columns
- Drop columns that do not contribute to the prediction task (e.g., `LoanNr_ChkDgt`, `ChgOffDate`, `BalanceGross`).

### 2.2 Handling Missing Values
- For numerical columns:
  - Impute missing values using the mean, median, or a specific constant.
- For categorical columns:
  - Impute missing values with the most frequent category or create a "Missing" category.
- Drop columns with excessive missing data (e.g., >50%).

### 2.3 Data Type Conversion and Standardization
- Convert monetary columns (e.g., `DisbursementGross`, `GrAppv`, `SBA_Appv`) to numeric format (remove `$` and commas).
- Convert date columns (e.g., `ApprovalDate`, `DisbursementDate`) to datetime format.
- Standardize column names (e.g., lowercase, no spaces).

### 2.4 Duplicate Data Management
- Check for duplicate rows and remove them if necessary.

### 2.5 Feature Engineering and Creation
- Derive new features from existing columns:
  - Example: Create a `loan_duration` column (difference between `ApprovalDate` and `DisbursementDate`).
  - Create binary indicators from categorical columns (e.g., `LowDoc`, `RevLineCr`).

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 3.1 Univariate Analysis
- Visualize the distribution of numerical variables using histograms and boxplots.
- Analyze the frequency of categorical variables using bar plots.

### 3.2 Bivariate Analysis
- Investigate relationships between features and the target variable (`MIS_Status` or repayment status).
- For numerical variables:
  - Use scatterplots or boxplots to explore correlations.
- For categorical variables:
  - Use crosstabs and statistical tests (e.g., chi-squared test).

### 3.3 Identifying Key Predictors
- Identify features with strong correlations to the target variable.
- Eliminate features with low predictive power or redundancy.

## 4. Data Preparation for Machine Learning

### 4.1 Encoding Categorical Variables
- Apply appropriate encoding techniques:
  - One-Hot Encoding for variables with a small number of categories.
  - Label Encoding for ordinal variables.

### 4.2 Scaling and Normalization
- Normalize or standardize numerical variables if required (e.g., for distance-based models like SVM or KNN).

### 4.3 Splitting the Dataset
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

### 4.4 Addressing Class Imbalance
- Check for imbalances in the target variable.
- Apply techniques to handle imbalance:
  - Oversampling (e.g., SMOTE).
  - Undersampling.
  - Using class weights in models.

## 5. Model Development and Evaluation

### 5.1 Model Selection and Justification
- Evaluate multiple classification models:
  - Logistic Regression.
  - Decision Tree.
  - Random Forest.
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- Provide a brief explanation of the chosen model's working mechanism.

### 5.2 Model Training and Performance Evaluation
- Train the model on the training set.
- Evaluate the model on the test set using:
  - Confusion matrix.
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score.
  - AUC-ROC curve.

### 5.3 Hyperparameter Optimization
- Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters for the selected model.

## 6. Results Visualization and Insights

### 6.1 Data Insights Visualization
- Create visualizations to highlight key insights from the data:
  - Distribution plots.
  - Correlation heatmaps.

### 6.2 Model Performance Visualization
- Plot the ROC curve to evaluate classification performance.
- Display feature importance (e.g., using Random Forest or XGBoost).
